## Overview

We would like to provide a *classic* and *curated* list of the awesome books and papers on non-radiative recombination which are worth reading. We follow [the awesome manifesto](https://github.com/MaximAbramchuck/awesome-interview-questions/blob/master/awesome.md).

We add theoretical works mostly rather than specific examples of them. To include specific experimental work, one needs clear reasons why that works are important and *must-read* (e.g., first observation, realization or invention of something).

We adopt the [nature style](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide) with little tweak (titles are in boldface for clarity). 
There is no serious reason for this choice. APS journals do not show the titles. We present a short justification and description of an item after the hyphen at the end of the reference.
